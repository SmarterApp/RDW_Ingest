## RDW Ingest - Script Pipeline

### Helper functions for XML
XML support can be added to a Script class by calling:
 ```script.addXmlExtensions()```. We assume that an XML document
 will be converted into another XML document, and all elements, including
 commentsnot, not specifically altered, should appear in the converted
 document exactly as they appear in the original. 

This will automatically parse the input into a JDOM 2 Document, 
 which is made available to the scripts in the inherent variable ```document```.
 However, it will also enable some helper functions that act implicitly
 on the document, and may ease writing XML transformation scripts and
 make it unnecessary for the script writer to ever reference the
 document object explicitly. 
 
 Some examples follow:
#### Transform
 ```groovy
transform '//Movie' by { movie -> 
    if (movie.title == 'Jaws') {
        movie.title = movie.title.toUpperCase()
    }
}
```

Here ```//Movie``` is an XPath expression that returns all Movie elements
in the document. The code within the braces will be applied to each
matched elements, and follows general Groovy syntax rules. The ```movie ->```
syntax just
assigns a name for the element that the code within the braces can use.
It can be any string that makes sense for the script, or it can also be omitted. In this case,
the element is automatically assigned the name ```it```. 

For example, this script works exactly the same as the first one:

 ```groovy
transform '//Movie' by {  
    if (it.title == 'Jaws') {
        it.title = it.title.toUpperCase()
    }
}
```

The syntax ```movie.title``` (or ```it.title```) refers to the title
attribute of the movie element. It is shorthand for ```movie.getAttributeValue()```,
and ```movie.title = 'some text'``` is shorthand for ```movie.setAttribute('title', 'some text')```.
An exception to this rule is ```movie.text```, which is shorthand for
```movie.getText()```, and returns the text content of the movie element
instead of an attribute value.

For the transformation rule, any legal Groovy (or Java) syntax is allowed.
This includes if-then-else blocks, regular expressions, calls to external
services, etc.

It is also possible to delete an element in a transformation rule. 
For example:

 ```groovy
transform '//Movie' by { movie -> 
    if (movie.actor == 'Keanu Reeves') {
        delete movie
    }
}
```

#### Filter
Although deleting elements as part of a transform rule is possible, 
it is also possible to filter elements based on an in-or-out rule:

```groovy
delete '//Movie' when { movie -> 
    movie.actor == 'Keanu Reeves'
}
```

It is also possible to reverse this logic to delete all elements
(matching the XPath expression) that don't match the rule:
 
```groovy
delete '//Movie' unless { movie -> 
    movie.actor == 'Richard Basehart'
}
```

#### XSL transformations
Although the script pipeline is meant to replace XSL transformations,
it might happen that performing some work in XSL is preferable to 
writing Groovy rules. Therefore, a helper function for XSL has been provided:

```groovy
applyXsl xsl
```

The ```xsl``` variable here is defined in the configuration for the script,
and can be a string containing XSL rules, a file represented as a
```java.io.File``` object, or a ```java.io.InputStream``` object.

It is also possible to combine XSL transformations with additional
Groovy rules:

```groovy
applyXsl preprocessing

transform '//Movie' {movie ->
    if (movie.rating > 2) {
        movie.recommend = true
    } else {
        movie.recommend = false
    }
}

applyXsl postprocessing
```

#### Getting the results
Once all transformations have been applied to the XML document, it is
necessary to convert it back to a string and return it. The helper 
function outputXml does this, and should be the last statement
in the script:

```groovy
transform '//Movie' by {  
    if (it.title == 'Jaws') {
        it.title = it.title.toUpperCase()
    }
}


outputXml
```
