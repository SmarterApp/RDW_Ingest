## Ingest Services

This document describes the service end-points for the ingest services.
* The import service has data loading end-points.
* The task service has task trigger end-points. 
* All services have diagnostic end-points. 

### Authentication and Authorization
The import service requires an OAuth2 access token for the data loading end-points. This is a password grant token 
requested from the OpenAM server by a trusted client for a user of the system (the permissions are associated with 
the user). 

#### Fetch Password Grant Access Token
Accepts x-www-form-urlencoded data including client and user credentials and returns an access token.
* Host: OpenAM
* URL: `/auth/oauth2/access_token`
* Method: `POST`
* URL Params: 
  * `realm=/sbac`
* Data Params (except for `grant_type` values given are examples and should be replaced with real values):
  * `grant_type=password`
  * `username=user@example.com`
  * `password=UserPassword`
  * `client_id=client`
  * `client_secret=ClientSecret`
* Success Response:
  * Code: 200 (OK)
  * Content: 
    ```json
    {
      "scope": "cn givenName mail sbacTenancyChain sbacUUID sn",
      "expires_in": 36000,
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "refresh_token": "639ddaa9-f993-4c52-aec5-923d5a21ee23",
      "access_token": "20b55fc2-1b84-4412-8149-88cfa622db01"
    } 
    ```
* Error Response:
  * Code: 400 (Bad Request)
  * Content (specific error and description will vary):
    ```json
    {
      "error": "invalid_client",
      "error_description": "Client authentication failed"
    }
    ```
* Sample Call (curl):
```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  --data "grant_type=password&username=user@example.com&password=password&client_id=client&client_secret=secret" \
  https://openam/auth/oauth2/access_token?realm=/sbac
```

#### Test Access Token
Although not needed during normal operations, this call can be used to check an access token.
* Host: OpenAM
* URL: `/auth/oauth2/tokeninfo`
* Method: `GET`
* URL Params: 
  * `access_token={access_token}`
* Success Response:
  * Code: 200 (OK)
  * Content: 
    ```json
    {
      "sbacUUID": "599758d9e4b0fbecbf5fc586",
      "mail": "test@example.com",
      "sn": "Test",
      "scope": [
         "sbacUUID",
         "mail",
         "sn",
         "cn",
         "sbacTenancyChain",
         "givenName"
      ],
      "grant_type": "password",
      "cn": "Test",
      "realm": "/sbac",
      "sbacTenancyChain": "|CA|ASMTDATALOAD|STATE|1000|ART_DL|||CA|CALIFORNIA|||||||||",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": 35930,
      "givenName": "Test",
      "access_token": "20b55fc2-1b84-4412-8149-88cfa622db01"
    }
    ```
* Error Response:
  * Code: 400 (Bad Request)
  * Content (specific error and description will vary):
    ```json
    {
      "error": "invalid_request",
      "error_description": "Access Token not valid"
    }
    ```
* Sample Call (curl):
```bash
curl https://openam/auth/oauth2/tokeninfo?access_token=20b55fc2-1b84-4412-8149-88cfa622db01
```

### Import Endpoints
The import service provides the end-points for submitting data to the system. The import requests are processed and 
migrated to the reporting data mart. Import payloads are hashed and duplicate content is detected, returning any 
previous import request for the given content. Thus submitting a payload a second time will safely no-op and return 
the current status of the previous import.

All data submissions result in an import being created. Thus a POST to `/exams/imports` will create an `import` 
resource which can be accessed at `/imports/{id}` (note that `exams` is not in the path). These are the end-points
for query imports.
 
All end-points require a valid token, the examples use `{access_token}` as a placeholder. The token must provide 
the `ASMTDATALOAD` role at the client or state level.

#### Get Import Request
This end-point may be used to get the current status of an import request.

* Host: import service
* URL: `/imports/{id}`
* Method: `GET`
* Params: none
* Headers:
  * `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`
* Success Response:
  * Code: 200 (OK)
  * Content:
    ```json
    {
      "id": 19529,
      "content": "EXAM",
      "contentType": "application/xml",
      "digest": "5899C64887FE25BC1F015FD7C26476E4",
      "status": "BAD_DATA",
      "creator": "user@example.com",
      "created": "2017-05-08T19:45:20.476Z",
      "message": "{\"elementName\":\"Sex\",\"value\":\"M\",\"error\":\"unknown gender name [M]\"},{\"elementName\":\"GradeLevelWhenAssessed\",\"value\":\"SIXTHGRADE\",\"error\":\"unknown grade code [SIXTHGRADE]\"}",
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "http://import-service/imports/19529"
        },
        "payload": {
          "href": "http://import-service/imports/19529/payload"
        },
        "payload-properties": {
          "href": "http://import-service/imports/19529/payload/properties"
        }  
      }
    }
    ```
* Error Response:
  * Code: 401 (Unauthorized) if token is missing or invalid.
  * Code: 403 (Forbidden) if token doesn't provide the `ASTMDATALOAD` role.
  * Code: 404 (Not Found) if no import with the given id exists.
* Sample Call (curl):
```bash
curl --header "Authorization:Bearer {access_token}" https://import-service/imports/19529
```

#### Get Import Payload
This end-point may be used to get the payload for an import request. 

* Host: import service
* URL: `/imports/{id}/payload`
* Method: `GET`
* Params: none
* Headers:
  * `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`
* Success Response:
  * Code: 200 (OK)
  * Content: File attachment
* Error Response:
  * Code: 401 (Unauthorized) if token is missing or invalid.
  * Code: 403 (Forbidden) if token doesn't provide the `ASTMDATALOAD` role.
  * Code: 404 (Not Found) if no import with the given id exists.
* Sample Call (curl):
```bash
curl --header "Authorization:Bearer {access_token}" https://import-service/imports/19529/payload
```

#### Get Import Payload Properties
This end-point may be used to get the payload properties for an import request. This can be useful because not all
the properties for an import are stored in the data warehouse, some are archived only with the payload.

* Host: import service
* URL: `/imports/{id}/payload/properties`
* Method: `GET`
* Params: none
* Headers:
  * `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`
* Success Response:
  * Code: 200 (OK)
  * Content: 
    ```json
    {
      "Content-Type": "application/xml",
      "filename": "test.xml",
      "batch": "CAF4901EA92C0A77A6DB6C37E8582852",
      "tenancy-chain": "|SBAC|ASMTDATALOAD|CLIENT|SBAC||||||||||||||",
      "username": "user@example.com"
    }
    ```
* Error Response:
  * Code: 401 (Unauthorized) if token is missing or invalid.
  * Code: 403 (Forbidden) if token doesn't provide the `ASTMDATALOAD` role.
  * Code: 404 (Not Found) if no import with the given id exists.
* Sample Call (curl):
```bash
curl --header "Authorization:Bearer {access_token}" https://import-service/imports/19529/payload/properties
```


### Exam Endpoints
End-points for submitting exams aka test results.

#### Create Exam Import Request
Accepts payloads in Test Result Transmission ([TRT][3]) format, creating new exam import requests. 

There are two ways of posting exam content: with a raw body of type `application/xml` or form-data (file upload).

* Host: import service
* URL: `/exams/imports`
* Method: `POST`
* URL Params: any URL param will be preserved as properties for the upload, well-known params:
  * `batch=<batchtag>`
  * `filename=<originalFileName>`  (not needed for form-data)
* Headers:
  * `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`
* Headers (raw body):
  * `Content-Type:application/xml`
* Body (raw body): TRT
* Headers (form-data):
  * `Content-Type:multipart/form-data`
* Form Data (form-data):
  * `file` - the upload file
  * `filename=<filename>`
  * any other form data will be preserved as properties for the upload
* Success Response:
  * Code: 202 (Accepted)
  * Content:
    ```json
    {
      "id": 19529,
      "content": "EXAM",
      "contentType": "application/xml",
      "digest": "5899C64887FE25BC1F015FD7C26476E4",
      "status": "ACCEPTED",
      "creator": "user@example.com",
      "created": "2017-05-08T19:45:20.476Z",
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "http://import-service/imports/19529"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
* Error Response:
  * Code: 401 (Unauthorized) if token is missing or invalid.
  * Code: 403 (Forbidden) if token doesn't provide the `ASTMDATALOAD` role.
* Sample Call (raw body):
```bash
curl -X POST --header "Authorization:Bearer {access_token}" --header "Content-Type:application/xml" \
  --data-binary "<TDSReport><Test..." https://import-service/exams/imports?batch=WinterICA&filename=winterICA.1.xml
```
* Sample Call (form-data):
```bash
curl -X POST --header "Authorization:Bearer {access_token}" -F file=@winterICA.1.xml -F batch=WinterICA \
  https://import-service/exams/imports
```
  
#### Resubmit Exams
The system accepts and stores import payloads regardless of processing status. For imports with certain problems like 
an unknown school or assessment, the import may be "replayed" once the underlying cause is resolved. For example, if
the missing school is added to the system, all affected exams can be resubmitted, without requiring the client to 
re-post the data. Note that this is meant as an operational utility; if it is being used regularly there are probably
fundamental data flow issues. 

* Host: import service
* URL: `/exams/imports/resubmit`
* Method: `POST`
* URL Params: query params can be used to restrict which exams to include; typically the status
  * `status=<status>` where status may be `UNKNOWN_SCHOOL`, `UNKNOWN_ASMT`, `ACCEPTED`
  * `after=<interval>` where interval is like `-PT1H` 
  * `creator=<creator>`
  * `batch=<batchtag>`
* Headers:
  * `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`
* Success Response:
  * Code: 200
  * Content: number of exams found and resubmitted. Note that a single call is limited to 100. If the return value is
  100, it is likely there are more exams matching the query and additional resubmit calls should be made. 
    ```text
    7
    ```
* Error Response:
  * Code: 401 (Unauthorized) if token is missing or invalid.
  * Code: 403 (Forbidden) if token doesn't provide the `ASTMDATALOAD` role.
* Sample Call:
```bash
curl -X POST --header "Authorization:Bearer {access_token}" https://import-service/exams/imports/resubmit?status=UNKNOWN_SCHOOL
```

  
### Organization Endpoints
End-points for submitting organization data; this includes districts, schools, and groups of institutions. 

#### Create Organization Import Request
Accepts JSON payload, compatible with the format produced by ART. The payload should contain all the organization
data necessary to resolve all contents; for example, if a school is in a group under a district, all three must
be present in the payload. The payload must be valid JSON but the exact structure doesn't matter a lot: the system
will parse the payload looking for the required fields: `entityType`, `entityId`, `entityName`, `parentEntityId`. 

There are two ways of posting content: with a raw body of type `application/json` or form-data (file upload).

* Host: import service
* URL: `/organizations/imports`
* Method: `POST`
* URL Params: any URL param will be preserved as properties for the upload, well-known params:
  * `filename=<originalFileName>`  (not needed for form-data)

          "href": "http://import-service/imports/19529"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
* Error Response:
  * Code: 401 (Unauthorized) if token is missing or invalid.
  * Code: 403 (Forbidden) if token doesn't provide the `ASTMDATALOAD` role.
* Sample Call (raw body):
```bash
curl -X POST --header "Authorization:Bearer {access_token}" --header "Content-Type:application/json" \
  --data-binary "{ \"districts\": [..." https://import-service/organizations/imports?filename=ART.json
```
* Sample Call (form-data):
```bash
curl -X POST --header "Authorization:Bearer {access_token}" -F file=@ART.json https://import-service/organizations/imports

### Task Endpoints
There are a few tasks that are configured to run periodically (typically once a day). These end-points allow those
tasks to be manually triggered on demand. These end-points are part of the actuator framework so they are exposed on
a separate port (8008) which is typically kept behind a firewall in a private network. No authentication is required. 

#### Update Organizations Task
The update organization task retrieves all schools from ART and posts them to the import service. This is typically
scheduled to happen every day in the wee hours. To trigger an immediate execution: 

* Host: task service
* URL: `/updateOrganizations`
* Method: `POST`
* Success Response:
  * Code: 200
* Sample Call:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8008/updateOrganizations
```

### Status Endpoints
End-points for querying the status of the system. These are intended primarily for operations but can be useful when
initially connecting to the system. These end-points are exposed on a separate port (8008) which is typically kept 
behind a firewall in a private network. No authentication is required.

#### Get Diagnostic Status
This end-point may be used to get the status of a service.

* Host: any RDW service
* URL: `/status`
* Method: `GET`
* URL Params:
  * `level=#` where # can be 0-5; optional, default is `level=0`
* Success Response:
  * Code: 200 (OK)
  * Content: varies based on level; for `level=0`:
    ```json
    {
      "statusText": "Ideal",
      "statusRating": 4,
      "level": 0,
      "dateTime": "2017-05-11T23:26:51.523+0000"
    }
    ```
* Sample Call (curl):
```bash
curl http://localhost:8008/status?level=2
```

#### Actuator Endpoints
As Spring Boot applications there are a number of `actuator` end-points that provide information about the status and
configuration of the system. See [Actuator Endpoints][1] for a full (technical) description of these end-points. Like 
the status end-point these are exposed on a separate port (8008) and do not require authentication. 
A list of the most useful:
* Host: any RDW service
* URL:
  * `/health` - a simple health check
  * `/info` - arbitrary application info
  * `/configprops` - configuration properties
  * `/env` - configurable environment properties
  * `/loggers` - shows and modifies configuration of loggers
  * `/metrics` - application metrics
  * `/trace` - trace information, last 100 HTTP requests
* Sample Call (curl):
```bash
curl http://localhost:8008/configprops
```
