<!-- Notes
This was initially done for Summative only. However, there is also an "Initial ELPAC".
These notes will include issues and concerns with the Initial ELPAC even though that
test is not yet being specified or reported on.

Glossary / Definitions:
CSEM = Conditional Standard Error of Measurement

Summative:
  Overall Scale Score: 1150-1950, Perf Level: 1-4
  Oral Language Scale Score: 1150-1950, CSEM: 000-999, Perf Level: 1-4
  Written Language Scale Score: 1150-1950, CSEM: 000-999, Perf Level: 1-4
  https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/ep/documents/elpacsummscalescore.pdf  <- has cut-points by grade

Initial:
  Overall Scale Score: 150-600
    1: Novice aka "Minimally Developed", 150-369
    2: Intermediate aka "Somewhat to Moderately Developed", 370-449
    3: Initially Fluent English Proficient (IFEP) aka "Well Developed", 450-600
  Oral Perf Level: 1-3 (no scores that i can see)
  Written Perf Level: 1-3 (no scores that i can see)

Domains (same for both Summative and Initial):
  Listening Perf Level: 1-3
  Speaking Perf Level: 1-3
  Reading Perf Level: 1-3
  Writing Perf Level: 1-3
Composites:
  Oral = Listening & Speaking
  Written = Reading & Writing  aka Literacy

-->

<!--
Investigate doing this with composite -> claim, domain -> target
 - claims have scores so that's good
   - need to display scale-score for claims (subject configurable?)
   - need to add scale-score, etc. for export
 - targets don't really have score or performance level
   - can we use residual_scores to somehow store the performance level
   - targets are not exported in CSV
   - TODO - are there target levels available that we're just not capturing?

Why?
 - composite scores seem more important for users, so we want to highlight them (over domain perf. levels)
 - short-term solution for this year
 - after using it, we'll know better how to enhance it in the future
