        <Description>Some students who are deaf or hard of hearing and who typically use ASL may need this accommodation when accessing text-based content in the assessment. The use of this accommodation may result in the student needing additional overall time to complete the assessment. For many students who are deaf or hard of hearing, viewing signs is the only way to access information presented orally. It is important to note, however, that some students who are hard of hearing will be able to listen to information presented orally if provided with appropriate amplification and a setting in which extraneous sounds do not interfere with clear presentation of the audio presentation in a listening test.

        <Description>Students with attention difficulties may need this support for viewing the test when digitally- provided color contrasts do not meet their needs. Some students with visual impairments or other print disabilities (including learning disabilities) also may need this support. Choice of colors should be informed by evidence of those colors that meet the student’s needs. Enable students to adjust screen background or font color, based on student needs or preferences. This may include reversing the colors for the entire interface or choosing the color of font and background. (EMBEDDED)</Description>

          <Description>Students with visual impairments may read text via braille. Tactile overlays and graphics also may be used to assist the student in accessing content through touch. Due to limitations with refreshable braille technology and math braille codes, refreshable braille is available only for ELA. For math, braille will be presented via embosser; embosser-created braille can be used for ELA also. Alternative text descriptions are embedded in the assessment for all graphics. The type of braille presented to the student (contracted or non-contracted) is set in ART, or member’s comparable platform. The use of this accommodation may result in the student needing additional overall time to complete the assessment. (EMBEDDED)</Description>

          <Description>For students whose primary language is not English and who use dual language supports in the classroom, use of the stacked (dual language) translation may be appropriate. Students participate in the assessment regardless of the language. This support will increase reading load and cognitive load. The use of this support may result in the student needing additional overall time to complete the assessment. Use of this support will likely also require separate setting or extra time.

The student can make text nd graphics larger by clicking the Zoom In button. The student can click the Zoom Out button to return to the default or smaller print size. When using the zoom feature, the student only changes the size of text and graphics on the current screen. To increase the default print size of the entire test (from 1.5X to 3.0X default size), the print size must be set for the student in the Administration and Registration Tool (ART), or member’s comparable platform), or set by the test administrator prior to the start of the test. This is the only feature that test administrators can set. The use of this universal tool may result in the student needing additional overall time to complete the assessment.

        <Label>Mouse Pointer (EMBEDDED)</Label>
        <Description>Students who are visually impaired and need additional enlargement or a mouse in a different color to more readily find their mouse pointer on the screen will benefit from the Mouse Pointer support. Students who have visual perception challenges will also find this beneficial. The size and color are set during registration and cannot be changed during the administration of the assessment. Students should have ample opportunity to practice during daily instruction with the size and color to determine student preference. The Mouse Pointer can be used with the Zoom universal tool. If students are using a magnification program (See Designated Support, Magnification), the enlarged mouse pointer is built into magnification programs and Mouse Pointer may not be needed.

        <Description>Students may have difficulty hearing the listening portion of the passage and also do not have enough functional vision to read the closed captioning provided for the passage. These students who are visually impaired or blind and deaf or hard of hearing AND who use braille may have access to Braille Transcripts. These students must be registered in ART, or members’ comparable platform, for both Braille and Closed Captioning. The use of this accommodation may result in the student needing additional overall time to complete the assessment. (EMBEDDED)</Description>

        <Description>Scratch paper to make notes, write computations, or record responses may be made available. Only plain paper or lined paper is appropriate for ELA. Graph paper is required beginning in sixth grade and can be used on all math assessments. A whiteboard with marker may be used as scratch paper. As long as the construct being measured is not impacted, assistive technology devices, including low-tech assistive technology (Math Window), are permitted to make notes, including the use of digital graph paper. The assistive technology device needs to be familiar to the student and/or consistent with the child's IEP or 504 plan. Access to internet must be disabled on assistive technology devices. CAT: All scratch paper must be collected and securely destroyed at the end of each CAT assessment session to maintain test security. All notes on whiteboards or assistive technology devices must be erased at the end of each CAT session. Performance Tasks: For mathematics and ELA performance tasks, if a student needs to take the performance task in more than one session, scratch paper, whiteboards, and/or assistive technology devices may be collected at the end of each session, securely stored, and made available to the student at the next performance task testing session. Once the student completes the performance task, the scratch paper must be collected and securely destroyed, whiteboards should be erased, and notes on assistive technology devices erased to maintain test security.

          <Description>Students who are easily distracted (or may distract others) in the presence of other students, for example, may need an alternate location to be able to take the assessment. The separate setting may be in a different room that allows them to work individually or among a smaller group. The student may read aloud to self, use a device requiring voicing (e.g., a Whisper Phone), or use Amplification. It may also include a calming device or support as recommended by educators and/or specialists. Or, the separate setting may be in the same room but in a specific location (for example, away from windows, doors, or pencil sharpeners, in a study carrel, near the teacher’s desk, or in the front of a classroom). Some students may benefit from being in an environment that allows for movement, such as being able to walk around. In some instances, students may need to interact with instructional or test content outside of school, such as in a hospital or their home. A specific adult, trained in a manner consistent with the TAM, can act as test proctor (test administrator) when student requires it. (NON-EMBEDDED)</Description>

          <Description>This accommodation is appropriate for a very small number of students (estimated to be approximately 1–2% of students with disabilities participating in a general assessment). For students in grades 3–5, read aloud will not be an available accommodation. Content experts agree that this accommodation should not be provided during these grades because it would compromise the construct being measured. For students in grades 6–8 and 11, read aloud is available as an accommodation for students whose need is documented in an IEP or 504 plan. Reports can be run to indicate the percent of students who had access to read aloud on reading test passages. Readers should be provided to students on an individual basis – not to a group of students. A student should have the option of asking a reader to slow down or repeat text. Use of this support will likely also require separate setting or extra time. (NON-EMBEDDED)</Description>

          <Description>Students who have documented significant motor or processing difficulties, or who have had a recent injury (such as a broken hand or arm) that makes it difficult to produce responses may need to dictate their responses to a human, who then records the students’ responses verbatim on the ELA performance task full write. The full write is the second part of the performance task. The use of this accommodation may result in the student needing overall additional time to complete the assessment. For many of these students, dictating to a human scribe is the only way to demonstrate their composition skills. It is important that these students be able to develop planning notes via the human scribe, and to view what they produce while composing via dictation to the scribe. (NON-EMBEDDED)</Description>

          <Description>Students who have motor or processing disabilities (such as dyslexia) or who have had a recent injury (such as a broken hand or arm) that make it difficult to produce text or commands using computer keys may need alternative ways to work with computers. Students will need to be familiar with the software, and have had many opportunities to use it prior to testing. Speech-to-text software requires that the student go back through all generated text to correct errors in transcription, including use of writing conventions; thus, prior experience with this accommodation is essential. If students use their own assistive technology devices, all assessment content should be deleted from these devices after the test for security purposes. For many of these students, using voice recognition software is the only way to demonstrate their composition skills. Still, use of speech-to-text does require that students know writing conventions and that they have the review and editing skills required of students who enter text via the computer keyboard. It is important that students who use speech-to-text also be able to develop planning notes via speech-to-text, and to view what they produce while composing via speech-to-text. Use of this support will likely also require separate setting or extra time. (NON-EMBEDDED)</Description>

Due to limitations with refreshable braille technology and math braille codes, refreshable braille is available only for ELA. For math, braille will be presented via embosser; embosser-created braille can be used for ELA also. Alternative text descriptions are embedded in the assessment for all graphics. The type of braille presented to the student (contracted or non-contracted) is set in ART, or member’s comparable platform. The use of this accommodation may result in the student needing additional overall time to complete the assessment. (EMBEDDED)</Description>

Use of word prediction does require that students know writing conventions and that they have the review and editing skills required of all students. It is important that students who use word prediction also be able to develop planning notes and review their writing with or without text-to-speech.
